#build a simple Employee Management System using Python. Store the details of employees in a dictionary where the employee ID is the key and the value is another dictionary containing the employee's name, department, and salary.
#Write a Python program that:
#Stores details of at least 3 employees.
#Takes an employee ID as input from the user.
#If the employee ID exists, display the employee's name, department, and salary.
#If the employee ID does not exist, display "Employee not found!".
